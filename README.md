# HTTP server for working with calendar. 
This is my assignment at WB tech school to study API methods.The project is a calendar application with an implemented REST API. The application has an onion architecture for further expansion. 
The server processes URL requests from the browser and returns a response in the form of a JSON document. 
## API endpoints: 
### POST /create_event 
### POST /update_event 
### POST /delete_event 
### GET /events_for_day 
### GET /events_for_week
